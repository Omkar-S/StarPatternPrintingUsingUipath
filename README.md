Hi,

# ðŸŒŸ Basic Star Pattern Printing Using UiPath

This project demonstrates how to **print star (`*`) patterns using UiPath Studio**, showcasing the use of **loops, control flow, and variables** in Robotic Process Automation (RPA).  

Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful example for **beginners in UiPath** to understand how programming logic can be implemented visually using activities like `For Each`, `Assign`, and `Write Line`.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

In this project, UiPath workflows are designed to print different types of star patterns directly in the **Output panel** using multiple approaches.

### âœ¨ Patterns Covered:
1. Right-Angled Triangle  
2. Inverted Triangle  
3. Pyramid Pattern  
4. Diamond (Optional / Extension idea)

Example output (for a right-angled triangle of 5 rows):

Thanks,
